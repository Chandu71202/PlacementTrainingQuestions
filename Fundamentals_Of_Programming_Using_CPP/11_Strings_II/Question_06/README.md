# Counting

These days kids at Nalanda University are introduced to computers at a very early age. The kids are taught about alphabets, digits and blank spaces. Sheldon Cooper asked the students to count the vowels, consonants, digits and white spaces in a string. Sheldon found it a bit difficult to evaluate these tests and he knew that the 12th class students are learning C programming. So he assigned this task to them to count the vowels, consonants, digits and white spaces in a string. Can you please help them out? Write a program to count the vowels, consonants, digits, white spaces, and symbols in a string.
