# Rotating The Matrix

-   Thomas, a computer programmer, is led to fight an underground
    war against powerful computers who now rule the world with
    a system called 'The Matrix'.
-   To win against the system, he must rotate the Matrix
    clockwise by an angle of 90 degrees.
-   Unfortunately the system has wiped Thomas' memory and it
    is now in your hands to save the world.
-   The matrix can be considered as a 2-Dimensional Array of size N x N.
-   SEE THE SAMPLE INPUT OUTPUT FOR CLARITY

### Input Format

-   The first line contains the size of the matrix N.
-   The next N lines contain N integers each, together denoting
    the square matrix of size N x N.

### Constraints

-   1 <= N <= 10

### Output Format

-   Output the final matrix after rotation.
