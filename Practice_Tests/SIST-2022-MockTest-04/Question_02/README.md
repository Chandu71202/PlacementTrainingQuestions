# Question 02

John, while participating in one of the contest, he encountered a binary search 
tree traversal based problem. As tree concept is one of his weak links, he was 
unable to think of any solution for the problem and has become sad.

Can you help John and make him happy by writing a program to create a binary 
search tree and print level order traversal in a way that nodes of all levels 
are printed on separate lines.

### Input Format

Number of elements in first line(N) <br>
N Tree elements in second line separated by space.

### Output Format

Display the level order traversal as shown in the sample output.

```

### Output 1
